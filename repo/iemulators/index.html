It was created by talented developer, Carlo Tortorella. The project started as a simple program that copy magnet links to the clipboard, but quickly became much more when he couldn’t find an app to do exactly what he needed.

This app can connect to a multitude of torrenting applications. It currently supports Deluge, qBittorrent, ruTorrent (HTTPRPC plugin), rTorrent (XMLRPC), SeedStuff, Synology, Transmission, Vuze, and uTorrent.

It also includes a query system that lets you easily search any torrent website that inserts the query into the URL, while also letting you add extra modifiers to automatically sort by whichever parameter you desire.

IMPORTANT: iEmulators does not condone piracy. There are thousands of legal sites that offer torrenting as a method of download.",

The emulator was released with the help of MacBuildServer through a iOS Developer Enterprise certificate and garnered popularity in 2013 until it was final its certificate was finally shut down by Apple on July 17, 2013. It didn't stay dead as Apple would have hoped, though, and lived on thanks to a loophole that permitted its installation by changing an iOS device's date back.

                "description": "GBA4iOS is a Game Boy Advance emulator created by iOS developer Riley Testut. Built and designed from the ground up for iOS 7, GBA4iOS takes advantage of many tools provided in the iOS SDK to take emulation to the next level. Simplicity and speed are big factors, but it is also powerful, being able to emulate not just GBA, but GBC and GB games. 2.0 also includes numerous, highly-requested features such as Cheats, iPad optimization, AirPlay, Dropbox sync and more. 

After the first version of GBA4iOS took off and was downloaded worldwide, what imminently followed was Apple getting involved and shutting down the distribution method altogether, forcing people to rely on a popular "date trick" loophole. Riley didn't see this as defeat and pursued a comeback in the form of version 2.0, which was worked on for the better part of a year. A closed beta testing was held in September 2013 that lasted almost 6 months with as many as 40 people helping to make sure the app was stable enough for release. 

On February 19, 2014, GBA4iOS 2.0 was finally released to much anticipation. It has been downloaded over 10 million times and remains one of the most popular and easily downloadable emulators available today.",

The emulator automatically saves your progress every time you change games and when you quit, no action needed. Gearboy requires ROM images to play and no ROMs are included. If you own any games, add them through iTunes Sharing.

The developer originally intended to sell Gearboy through Cydia and he accomplished as much; however, only hours later, the app was taken down due to some issues. A week later, Ignacio decided to forget about making money with it and distribute Gearboy for free.",

Way before handheld and portable gaming was popular, arcades where the places in our childhood where we would waste all of our coins at. These arcade machines were big builky games consoles with a lot of confusing buttons and a joystick where we could spend the day away playing Mortal Kombat or Marvel vs Capcom. This emulator brings back those nostalgic days.

iFBA is popular among jailbroken retro game enthusiasts, but it's rarely been seen available for non-jailbroken. This version includes a lot of features, although some of these won't work due to the fact that they require you to be jailbroken (like the Wiimote connectivity), but you can still enjoy most of it just fine.

One of its most notable features is that you can see all kinds of games you can install on this emulator through the "missing" section. You obviously cannot download them directly (or even access info for some reason) as that would be illegal but it is helpful in helping you find some you may like! This emulator plays many different kinds of ROMs such as CPS1, CPS2, CPS3, Cave, Konami, MAME, Neo Geo, and more. 

Other features include high customization in settings. You can adjust the video aspect ratio, frameskip, and even screen mode. You can also adjust the sound frequency and output, change controllers (although some require jailbreak) and disable the arm core if your device isn't that powerful.

Note: There is currently no "Open In..." feature so most game installations will require you to use iTunes Sharing or an app like iExplorer or iFunbox. This is achieved by adding the compressed ROMs to the "Documents" folder in the root. 

IMPORTANT: Before you even begin installing or playing a game, head to "Settings" after launching and select "ROMs Paths." Tap on zero (0) and select "/var/mobile/Documents/iFBA/" if you wish to be able to install any game at all! The only way currently that we have found to install games without a computer is through iFile, which requires you to be jailbroken. We're working on new ways to improve this.",

          "description": "Formerly known as SiOS, MeSNEmu is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator created by Lucas Mendes Menge which he developed as a hobby in order to have a more modern and stable SNES emulator for iOS.

Lucas is a developer born in Recife, Brazil who chose to develop apps for the iPhone. He graduated from UNICAP in 2008 and since has worked with other people on various projects such as MeSNEmu and Orbit.

Previously available emulators of this kind were either only obtainable on Cydia (which requires being jailbroken), simply didn't run well when "home built" due to a much-outdated SNES9X codebase or simply had messy iOS implementations. In fact, this project started as a Xcode-compatible port of ZodTTD's snes4iphone and has been since rewritten beyond recognition.

MeSNEmu is a fun way to take a step back to the days when the SNES systems ruled the market.

In October 2014, the popular SNES emulator changed its name from SiOS to MeSNEmu. It is not confirmed but it is more than likely it was changed to differentiate from a tech company in California known as SIOS and avoid potential issues.",

          "description": "nds4ios, a Nintendo DS emulator, is a port of the multi-platform DeSmuME 0.9.10 for iOS. It runs many of the original games but, depending on the power of your device, not all may run at full speed. nds4ios was created by InfiniDev, a joint development group with many members including popular GBA4iOS creator Riley Testut (@rileytestut), upcoming Nightingale app developer Michael Zhang (@malvix_) and PPSSPP iOS build manager Karen Tsai (@angelxwind), along with many others. However, as of August 2014, the team has since disbanded and nds4ios is no longer being updated or worked on.

nds4ios supports all versions of iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch running iOS 5 and above; except iPod touch 4, iPad 1, iPhone 3GS, and anything below those devices. This is because nds4ios’s emulation is powered by a threaded ARM interpreter. As a result, emulation is rather slow on older devices, like the iPhone 4s and below. nds4ios runs at nearly full speed on the iPhone 5 and above, and achieves full speed on devices using the A7-S5L8960X SoC (iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini Retina, and anything newer than these devices).

The emulator does not require bios to play but requires ROM images and no ROMs are provided - it is up to you to procure them. If you own any games, add them through iTunes Sharing or the “Open in” feature. The "+" button feature is no longer included in this version due to legal issues with Nintendo in the past. 

On August of 2014, nds4ios was engaged in some legal issues with Nintendo that has since ruined all hope of continuing with future updates. Many weeks after the source and download links were taken down and the app could not be downloaded officially anywhere, iEmulators has been granted special permission by one of their developers to continue distributing the app. Please know that this will be the last version updated (possibly forever) and that neither nds4ios developers or iEmulators can help you with support issues pertaining to updating the app or fixing potential bugs.",
